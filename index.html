  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Welcome to the introduction of my interaction design project, focused on gamifying a <br>
    learning app. Our aim is to make the learning experience more engaging and interactive <br>
    for our users.<br>
    Gamification involves applying game design principles to non-game contexts, such as <br>
    education. The objective is to increase user motivation, engagement, and enjoyment. <br>
    This project involved various phases, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, <br>
    prototyping, and usability testing. The competitive analysis will helped me identify <br>
    strengths and weaknesses in the existing market, and highlight areas we can improve. <br>
    Wireframing and prototyping allowed us to design and develop the interface and user <br>
    experience of the app, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable learning process. <br>
    Finally, usability testing was conducted to gather feedback from users on the app's <br>
    usability and functionality. The feedback will be used to refine and improve the app, <br>
    ensuring that the user's needs are met. <br>
    Overall, our aim is to create a learning app that is not only effective but also enjoyable, <br>
    ultimately improving the user's learning outcomes. <br>
